In this repository a shell script can be found which is used in a linux terminal to find all occurences of the word "de" within a wikipedia page.
Specifically we used the wikipedia page of the Rijks universiteit Groningen which can be found using this link https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijksuniversiteit_Groningen
within the shell script most of the documentation about how it is used is commented so for more information check out the milestone_5.sh file.
In this file the offline version of the wikipedia page is used which is also added in this github repository. 
The amount of occurences of "de" in this wikipedia page is 6210.
